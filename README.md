# JavaFX UI Sandbox #
Oracle has opened up the [JavaFX UI Sandbox repository](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/openjfx/sandbox-8/controls/rt) on OpenJFX as announced on the [fxExperience blog](http://fxexperience.com/2012/10/announcing-the-javafx-ui-controls-sandbox/). 
Controls in the OpenJFX repository might eventually be included in a next JavaFX release.

This GitHub project is intended to provide simple `jar` files for some of those sandbox controls.

## JavaFX Dialogs ##
JavaFX Dialogs are simple dialogs in the style of [JOptionPane](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/dialog.html) from Swing.

For examples of how to use them see this blog post.
